## How does it work?

The option of this programm is to solve quadratic equations (Ax^2 + Bx + C =0) and print the roots in the terminal.
Coefficients can be entered from keyboard.
Also it has other options for testing and if you have LINUX - changing colours in terminal. All commands you can see in the usage of this programm.

If you want to change the colour of your terminal in this programm, you can use __colour__ command, which can show you list of colours you can to set:

If you forgot the commands you can use, you can write the command __help__



If you doubt the correctness of the program, you can test it with command __test__ ,which enters the values ​​from the file __TEST_PARAMETERS.txt__ , where 6 parameters are written in the line: 3 - coefficients A, B, C, 2 roots and the number of roots:
![Tests](for_readme/tests.png)


And now we can see the main command for this programm - __solve__


You need to enter 3 coefficients in turn from the keyboard, each time pressing __Enter__ . Immediately after entering all the coefficients, you can see all solutions of this equation:
